"""
Three-axis question ranker.

Scores a candidate question on three axes and returns a weighted float [0, 1].
Axes:
  1. load_bearing    — is the competency core to the blueprint section?
  2. likelihood      — does the question match the candidate's claimed skills?
  3. non_obviousness — is the question specific enough to not be a trivial lookup?

Weights: load_bearing=0.50, likelihood=0.30, non_obviousness=0.20
