"""Adversarial score verifier: second-pass LLM check on borderline scores.

Adapted from DeepInterview verifier.py (125 lines). Only scores in the
'developing' or 'novice' mastery bands are re-examined; mastery and proficient
scores pass through unchanged.

Safety-first: any LLM failure (timeout, malformed JSON, provider error)
leaves the original score object untouched rather than wiping a valid score.
