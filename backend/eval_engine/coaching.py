# module-2-ai-interview-agent/eval_engine/coaching.py
"""Say/Avoid/Fix coaching cards and model answer generation.

Produces two user-facing artefacts for each assessed competency:

* ``CoachingCard`` — three short coaching directives (what to say, what to
  avoid, and a concrete fix) derived from the competency verdict and a
  transcript excerpt. Generated via LLM with a rule-based fallback so offline
  tests always receive a well-formed card.

* Model answer — a short exemplar answer drafted from blueprint context.
  Falls back to a generic template when the LLM is unavailable.

LLM schema lifted from DeepInterview shared_models.py / post/report.py and
adapted to our LLMGateway.complete_json() interface and CoachingCard shape.
