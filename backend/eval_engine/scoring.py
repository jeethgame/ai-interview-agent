# module-2-ai-interview-agent/eval_engine/scoring.py
"""Five-component weighted interview scoring with dual weight profiles.

Adapted from ai-resume-matcher/app/matching/scorer.py (FULL_WEIGHTS,
NEUTRAL_WEIGHTS, lines 14-29). Component names re-mapped to interview context:

  skill_overlap    → technical_depth   (largest weight; core signal)
  role_alignment   → problem_solving   (second-largest)
  language_fit     → communication     (adjusted upward in neutral profile)
  seniority_fit    → behavioral        (stable across both profiles)
  experience_fit   → coverage          (session completeness proxy)

Adaptive redistribution (Feature #44): when one or more components are absent
from the input dict (or explicitly set to ``None``), their base weights are
proportionally spread across the present components so the total still reaches
0–100 rather than being silently depressed by missing data.
