"""Deterministic narrative assembly — Task 9.

Assembles a human-readable performance summary from a completed
``InterviewReport`` without invoking an LLM.  The output is fully
reproducible given the same report inputs.

Pattern adapted from ``generate_match_narrative()`` in
``cloned_repos/ai-resume-matcher/app/matching/scorer.py`` — changed from
job-match scoring to interview-performance framing.
