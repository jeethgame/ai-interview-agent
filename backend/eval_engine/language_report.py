# module-2-ai-interview-agent/eval_engine/language_report.py
"""Language quality assessment for interview transcripts.

Produces a ``LanguageReport`` capturing fluency, clarity, and filler-word
density from the candidate's answers.

Design:
* Filler-word count is computed heuristically (no LLM cost) using a curated
  word list so it is always available even without network access.
* Fluency and clarity scores are requested from the LLM; the function falls
  back to sensible defaults (60.0) when the LLM is unavailable.

Adapted from DeepInterview shared_models.LanguageReport (lines 179-186) and
post/language_coach.py.  Key differences:
  - Our schema uses ``filler_count`` (int) rather than ``filler_word_count``
    to match the task brief.
  - ``notes`` replaces the split ``code_switching_notes`` / ``pronunciation_notes``
    / ``summary`` fields for a leaner report shape.
  - We use ``LLMGateway.complete_json()`` rather than a bespoke deps object.
